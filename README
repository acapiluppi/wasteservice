# Waste Service data and scripts
This project holds the scripts and the data that were used to populate the 
Waste Service paper. The resulting components that were extracted are now 
available at the [Waste Service](http://wasteservice.github.io) online 
repository.

- the first step is to **isolate the components**: we do that by invoking 
the *streamline_Infomap.sh*script. It uses the CLI of the [Scitools 
Understand](https://licensing.scitools.com/download) analyzer, to extract the 
hard dependencies between Java classes. Afterwards, the script makes use of the 
[Infomap](https://www.mapequation.org/infomap/#Install) tool to extract the 
components as communities, based on the dependencies between classes.

- The second step is to extract the quality metrics. The *streamline_OO.sh* 
script uses the CLI of the 
[Scitools Understand](https://licensing.scitools.com/download) analyzer, and 
its accompanying file *core.xml*, to extract the OOmetrics that serve as a 
comparison between batches of projects.
